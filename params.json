{"name":"Setupcanonical","tagline":"For Users to experiment with setup","body":"#RAILS-poc\r\n\r\n`RAILS-poc` is designed to help developers write Ruby on Rails (_Rails_) applications within the _nys-its_. The RAILS-poc `code` can be used (i) to fast-track Rails application development, or (ii) as a template that you can use in your own applications. The RAILS-poc `Wiki` gives more detail on how the `master` versions/tags were created, as well as how to set-up, migrate, and contribute to rails applications within the _nys-its_.\r\n\r\n**Requirements:** This setup is designed for _Rails_ v4.0.2, _Ruby_ v2.0.0. (Developers using Windows-RailsInstaller setup are constrained to _Ruby_ v2.0.0. **Don't install _Rails_ >= v4.1** as it requires _Ruby_ >= v2.1)\r\n\r\n###How to Use RAILS-poc\r\n#####Fast-track your _Rails_ application development\r\n* Clone `RAILS-poc` to your machine's 'projects' folder. \r\n* `Basic Configuration`\r\n  * If you want to use all of the basic configuration, do nothing more, leave `head` at v0.04. Basic configuration includes the following installed and configured: home page, testing gems, debugging gems, mobile first responsive design gem.\r\n  * If you want some, but not all, of the 'basic configuration' you can `checkout` the appropriate `tag` on the `master` branch. You will get cumulatively more `basic configuration` as you `checkout` `tags` from v0.01 through v0.04.\r\n    * [v0.01](https://github.com/nys-its/rails-poc/wiki/v0.01-StaticPages-Home-Page) Static Pages tag - Home Page, README.md (.rdoc converted to .md)\r\n    * [v0.02](https://github.com/nys-its/rails-poc/wiki/v0.02-Testing) Testing tag - RSpec, Capybara, Spork, FactoryGirl\r\n    * [v0.03](https://github.com/nys-its/rails-poc/wiki/v0.03-Debugging) Debugging tag - ByeBug, BetterErrors, RailsPanel\r\n    * [v0.04](https://github.com/nys-its/rails-poc/wiki/v0.04-Mobile Responsive) Mobile First Responsive Design tag - Zurb Foundation\r\n* `Specific Functionality` \r\n  * Will be added over time as useful functional needs are identified\r\n  * Will be found on `branches`. Every `branch` will be a child of `v0.04`.\r\n  * To get the `specific function` on your machine, `checkout` `master` and merge the appropriate `branch`.\r\n\r\n#####Use code as a template that you can use in your own applications\r\n* Clone `RAILS-poc` to your machine's 'code' folder.\r\n* View code in editor\r\n\r\n#####Wiki\r\nGo to the [Wiki](https://github.com/nys-its/rails-poc/wiki) for more information.\r\n\r\n**v0.04 Home Page with Mobile Responsive Navigation**\r\n\r\n![homePage](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6201245/3433664/a3c55a0c-0081-11e4-905a-df013411b10c.png)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
